Travel Funds

We started this project with the idea that the Travel industry has an actual niche that remains untapped. 
Our target demographic was the untraveled, the grandparent, the technically clumsy or easily stressed consumer 
that could not digest the massive options they were presented when browsing for travel.

Blasphemy? Not quite. Travel agencies have existed for centuries because consumers that could afford to, subscribe 
to the simplicity of travel options offered.

Our app, although not specifically catered to that crowd is actually designed to perform the same exact functions. 
Whats more, we have designed it specifically for the wishful consumer, allowing them to put funds aside and visually 
see what they can afford.
